# This script smoke-tests the entire plugin by running a series of commands that collectively capture a vertical slice
# of the plugin, hitting every major piece of functionality. If they all succeed, then we can reasonably assume that
# the plugin is approximately stable.
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SCRIPT DIRECTLY! INSTEAD, MAKE CHANGES IN ./smoke-tests/SmokeTestGenerator.js AND RERUN THAT SCRIPT
# FROM THE PROJECT ROOT!

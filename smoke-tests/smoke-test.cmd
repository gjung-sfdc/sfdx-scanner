REM This script smoke-tests the entire plugin by running a series of commands that collectively capture a vertical slice
REM of the plugin, hitting every major piece of functionality. If they all succeed, then we can reasonably assume that
REM the plugin is approximately stable.
REM DO NOT EDIT THIS SCRIPT DIRECTLY! INSTEAD, MAKE CHANGES IN ./smoke-tests/SmokeTestGenerator.js AND RERUN THAT SCRIPT
REM FROM THE PROJECT ROOT!
